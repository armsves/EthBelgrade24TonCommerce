I created a "simple" telegram mini-app that any user can login with a telegram wallet and with a few clicks can create a store and products to sell on telegram.

I used tonKeeper wallet on testnet, the telegram mini-app template, a node server for the backend and a postgresql database to store the data.

The idea is that it will simplify the creation of stores and products within the telegram ecosystem.

to install
npm install

to run you need 2 instances
npm run dev
node /src/server.js

you can test live:

and
@TonCommerce telegram bot

Thanks!
